/v3/{agreementId}/production/electricity/graph  Get electricity production historical data.
/v3/{agreementId}/devices/{deviceid}/data  Can be used to retrieve the historical data for a connected device. The device id can contain special characters that must be URL encoded.
/v3/{agreementId}/devices/{deviceid}/flows  Can be used to retrieve the current data for a connected device. The device id can contain special characters that must be URL encoded.
/v3/{agreementId}/thermostat/states  Returns the different temperature state (setting) for the display. The temperature programs define in what state the display will go at a certain time and the state then defines the temperature value to use.
/v3/{agreementId}/consumption/electricity/flows  Returns the electricity consumption for a given time period in 5 minute intervals. The data is given for the time period between the given from- and toTime parameters. The data will be returned in an array appended under the field hours.
/v3/agreements  Returns the agreementID(s) that are associated with the utility customer. The agreementID is used in subsequent calls to access the data of one particular Toon.
/v3/{agreementId}/consumption/gas/data  Returns the gas consumption for a given time period. The data is given in the interval you specify and for the time period between the given from- and toTime parameters. If no parameters are specified, the default values will be used.
/v3/{agreementId}/production/electricity/delivery  Get electricity production data with the delivery to the grid.
/v3/{agreementId}/status  Returns information about current power usage, gas usage, thermostat information and thermostat programs as well as connected devices.
/v3/{agreementId}/consumption/electricity/data  Returns the electricity consumption for a given time period. The data is given in the interval you specify and for the time period between the given from- and toTime parameters. If no parameters are specified, the default values will be used.
/v3/{agreementId}/webhooks/{applicationId}  The operation allows an API client to unsubscribe a push event request
/v3/{agreementId}/thermostat  Gets the current thermostat information
/v3/{agreementId}/devices/{deviceid}  You need to send the configuration of the specific device as body. This configuration can be copied directly from the result from the corresponding GET. The device id can contain special characters that must be URL encoded.
/v3/{agreementId}/production/electricity/data  Get electricity production historical data.
/v3/{agreementId}/consumption/districtheat/data  Returns the district heat consumption for a given time period. The data is given in the interval you specify and for the time period between the given from- and toTime parameters. If no parameters are specified, the default values will be used.
/v3/{agreementId}/production/electricity/flows  Get electricity production flow data.
/v3/{agreementId}/consumption/gas/flows  Returns the gas consumption for a given time period in 5 minute intervals. The data is given for the time period between the given from- and to Time parameters. If no parameters are specified, the default value will be used, which is the last 24 hours.
/v3/{agreementId}/webhooks  The operation allows an API client to subscribe a push event request, which will permit to get the display status including all datasets via a push event whenever display sends an update to the backend API
/v3/{agreementId}/thermostat/programs  This method is currently not implemented.
/v3/{agreementId}/devices  Returns a list of all the connected devices and their configuration. These can be Smart Plugs, Philips Hues, etc.
