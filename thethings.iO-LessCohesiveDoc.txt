/v2/me/resources/RESOURCE?subscribe=true&keepAlive=TIME_MS  Subscribe to resource values Endpoint to subscribe to the real-time updates. Once subscribed, you will receive a message each time that the resource receives a new value. If there are no updates the server will send {} after the interval you specified for keepAlive. You should also keep a timer, and if you don�t receive updates after the keepAlive time is expired, you have to resubscribe. This could happen if the Wi-Fi is down or something happens to the connection. To subscribe from a browser we recommend to use Websocket. REST API subscription is not reliable on browsers.
/v2/me/things  How to Unlink a thing If you want to remove the ownership of a thing from a user, a procedure called unlink thing is necessary which allows the platform to know that the user is no longer the owner of the thing. In order to unlink the thing the user must be logged in and the thing must be activated and previously linked. Unlink thing from an app with the thing ID The thing lD could be retrieved from the GET:/me/things or GET:/me/resources After this, the app does not have access to the user's thing data anymore.

/v2/me/settings  Update User Settings Sometimes the app needs to store additional data about the user like gender, avatar, hair color, etc. In that case the app can use the endpoint '/me/settings' in order to set and get the user�s settings. The user�s settings are not meant to store large amounts of data. It�s more likely a small key/value store. Updates the settings key/value object. There is a special key password that will update the user�s password with the app.
